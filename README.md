# dehydrated-ovh-hook

Hooks to drive Dehydrated when using OVH as a hosting provider

## Why

There's a perfectly good Python version [here](https://github.com/rbeuque74/letsencrypt-ovh-hook). Unfortunately my system has issues with Python so it won't work.

## Using

The [Makefile](.\Makefile) will pull in the pre-requisites needed for the hooks file.
